# TaxTheGame
A game in which you can attempt to circumvent the System and bypass taxes, print money and use it to print even more money.

This game is one of our very first Android projects. It's very badly written and documented, since we knew nothing about well-documented code back then and had no experience with production-level programming, only with experimenting.

We decided to make it public, so everyone can see how NOT to write code.
